            <h5>&nbsp;Grief in Children&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Everyone grieves the loss of their loved ones, including children. Children grieve differently than adults, so it is important to keep an open mind. Marty Tousley wrote a blog post responding to one of their readers looking for advice about their child who is grieving. The reader discusses how her granddaughter was 7 years-old and lost her mom a few months ago and goes on to say that she believed her granddaughter was seeking attention from people because her mother died. She asked Tousley if this was normal grief behavior. Tousley discusses how children show grief differently and how they have shorter attention spans, making them go in and out of grief. This makes their symptoms of grief come and go as well and it can come in different intensities. They also mention that when dealing with grieving children you should focus less on their behavior and focus more on what they could be thinking and feeling (Tousley, 2014). The beginning of understanding grief in children is understanding that they grieve differently. After realizing children are grieving then it is up to you to be there for the child and help them get through it. <img src="image for paper.jpg" alt="image of an upset little girl with an adult who is comforting her." width="400" height="267" class="align-text-top"/></p>
<h5>&nbsp;Ways to Help </h5>
            <p>&nbsp;There are certain things you can do to help the grieving child and there are other resources than can be looked into for extra help. When children experience a loss they need more time and attention from their guardians, and they should be encouraged to talk about their feelings. You can encourage them to talk about their memories and feelings by talking about your own. Feeling, showing, and verbalizing your own feelings is a good way to show children that it is okay to feel that way. If you hold back your feelings while around children it could teach them to suppress their own feelings in the future, so it is important to share them (Tousley, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another way to help grieving children is to give them creative tasks. Hill and Lineweaver conducted a study to figure out if a visuospatial activity can improve the mood of grieving children (2016). For this experiment they used fifty-four children ranging from ages six to thirteen, all children used in this experiment went to a facility where they attended grieving groups. They provided a table with the demographics of the participants, it is located at the bottom of the page. They&nbsp; &nbsp;had four separate groups, the first group worked on a canvas piece using oil pastels or watercolor paints individually, the next group worked on one large canvas together, and the other two groups did puzzles, one group individually and the other group together. They had the children fill out their modified version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule before and after the task to see if there was a change. They found that the children working on art individually showed a decline in their negative feelings, while the other groups showed no significant change in mood (Hill and Lineweaver 2016). This study shows that another way to help grieving children is to work one on one with them, and to use creative intervention. Art can be a great tool to show and discuss emotions.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;In some cases grieving children need help processing their emotions. School social workers can be a good resource to start with when children need extra help. A research study by Quinn-Lee was done to answer the question, what are your experiences working with grieving children? (2014). This study was conducted to see what the grieving resources are in school. In this study fifty-nine social school workers filled out an email survey and twenty-two of them agreed to do an in-person interview. Most of them said that they do provide services for grieving children. There are ten services the school social workers said they offer, I will list a few,&nbsp;</p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Family counseling</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>&nbsp;referrals/resources</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>&nbsp;Education and training on grief and loss issues</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>&nbsp;Bibliotherapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They also mention that they see students grieving the loss of family members, pets, friends, and trusted adults(Quinn-Lee, 2014). Children grieve for so many people just like adults. This study showed that there are active resources at the school available to help students with grief. </p>
<h5>&nbsp;Reason for Caring </h5>
            <p>I think that it is very important to understand grief in children because it can change the way the child behaves and deals with emotions in the future, as well as, affect the child’s everyday life. Unresolved grief can also lead to depression and anxiety. It is hard for children to understand their own feelings, especially complex ones, so it is important to try and help them understand and deal with their emotions. I feel like grief goes unresolved a lot because it is hard to talk about, but there are consequences to not dealing with it. It is important for everyone to feel, discuss, and show their emotions. &nbsp;</p>
