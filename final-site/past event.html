            <h5>&nbsp;Introduction&nbsp;</h5>
<p> During my last year of High School, I skipped school on a Friday and rode the train for the first time to Chicago. I was with my boyfriend and this was the first trip we took together, a 4 hour train ride to Chicago from Springfield to see a concert.</p>
<h5>&nbsp;Chicago</h5>
<p>The train ride felt long but since I had my best friend with me it was bearable. I had never been on Amtrak before but I didn’t think it was as bad as some people say. When we arrived in Chicago we still had a lot of time to waste before the concert. We decided to walk around and ended up going to the Shedd Aquarium. It was my first time at this aquarium and it ended up being so fun. We ate dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and the food was amazing. After the Shedd and dinner we found the venue and got in line for the doors around 4 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>&nbsp;Before the Concert&nbsp;</h5>
<p>We ended up being third in line. We expected more people to be in line since the venue was so small and all general admission. It was so cold out that we figured that was why the line was so small. Eventually the line started to grow and the cold started to get worse. Eventually a bouncer at the venue moved the line inside, to get everybody out of the cold. Once the line got moved inside our third place spot didn’t really matter anymore because there were people lined up downstairs too. While we believed we were going to get a really close spot to the stage that didn’t happen. We were still let in before another line so we still got a good place to stand.</p>
<h5>The Concert&nbsp;</h5>
<p>The artist we went to see is Joji. He was originally a youtuber that went by the name of Filthy Frank, until he quit youtube to focus on his music. This was the first time we saw him live. He has a very good voice in person and he is also pretty funny onstage. He would make jokes throughout the concert and mixed his personality into his set. The concert was one of the best I have been to. It was also my boyfriend’s first concert ever. He absolutely loved it! He loved it so much that after the concert he said, “when is his next concert? I don’t care where or when it is, we are going!” This concert was almost four years ago now, he has remained as one of our favorite artists and we have been to two more of his concerts since then. He has a tour coming up in October, in Chicago, and we already have tickets and a hotel!</p>
